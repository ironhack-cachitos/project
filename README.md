# {cachitos}

Cachitos is an online warehouse to store little chunks (&lsquo;cachitos&rsquo;) of reusable code for your everyday pleasure.

Just pop to your clipboard a snippet of code you know you have to use often and paste it here.

It has Syntax highlighting via [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org) and copy to clipboard functionality via [clipboard.js](https://clipboardjs.com)

That's all! Pretty simple.
